AS3 Evaldraw Tutorial
July 16, 2010, by Bruce Jawn
1. Basic Functions
"Open Code"-Open saved Evaldraw code(.txt textfile).
"Save Code"-Save the code in code editor as .txt textfile.
"Dump AS3"-Export the Evaldraw code to .as class file(AS3), can be used to compile the swf.
"Screenshot"- Save the current Canvas as .png image files.
"Eval"-Run the code.
"Stop"-Stop running.
"Tutorial"-Display this text.
"About"-About this project.
"Edit Code"-Switch to the code editor.
"Canvas"-Switch to the graphical output.
"Output"-Switch to the text output.
2. Scripting
The scripting engine is BISE Scripting Engine, for details of the engine, please read "src\scripting\docs.htm".
Comply with the ECMAScript specification, support variables, arrays, objects and properties, if-tests, while loops and for loops, break and continue, with blocks and so on. 
example:"/*Variables and Operations*/var x = 10; var y = x + 20; trace(y);"
"/*Loop*/for (i=0;i<5;i++){trace(i*2);}"
3. Evaldraw API
Math: the same as AS3; example:"var a=Math.random();var b=Math.sin(a);"
stage: the same as AS3; example:"trace(stage.mouseX);"
trace: the same as AS3, display output results in text output panel;
Canvas: a Sprite object, call it directly; example:"trace(Canvas);"
Pen: =Canvas.graphics; Canvas's graphics property, used for calling AS3 graphics's drawing API.
example:"Pen.lineStyle(10,0xff0000);Pen.moveTo(12,4);Pen.lineTo(512,512);"
ScreenBuffer: graphical output, a BitmapData object;
example:"/*Rendering the results*/ScreenBuffer.draw(Canvas);";"/*Manipulate Screen Pixels*/ScreenBuffer.setPixel(6,6,0xff0000);"
onEnterFrame: The onEnterFrame function like in AS2; example:"stage.frameRate=80;function onEnterFrame(){trace(stage.frameRate);}"
For more information, please see the source code with routines(\Evaldraw_examples\).
4. Notes
Code delimiter ";" should not be omitted.
Code comments, please use the multi-line comments "/**/", do not support the one-line comment "//".
